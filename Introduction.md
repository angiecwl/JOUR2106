# Introduction

Hi!
My name is Angie, a final-year International Journalism student in Hong Kong Baptist University, currently interning at CNN’s Hong Kong newsroom.

In Summer 2018, I spent three months at the Hong Kong office of The New York Times. I would later spend two weeks in Perth, Australia as my first solo adventure out of Asia.

I was previously the Deputy Editor of The Young Reporter, the oldest student-run English publication in Hong Kong, in charge of Culture & Leisure and Business desks, as well as social media.

While struggling through the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education, I began writing under South China Morning Post’s Junior Reporters’ Club programme.

A true geek at heart, I enjoy things that range from but not limited to: 
* poetry
* animation
* technology 
* gaming 
* mainstream music
* and memes.

## Here's my face: (When I'm not tired, which is rare.)
