# Introduction

Hi!
My name is Angie, a final-year International Journalism student, currently interning at CNNâ€™s Hong Kong newsroom. 
That means I'm not at school a lot... But when I am, I try to get all my stuff done~

### To cut to the chase...
Pros:
* Coding: I did Information and Technology Communications in high school, focusing on web design. I'm rusty, but I know a bit.
* Languages: I'm fluent in both English and Cantonese, and communicable in Mandarin.
* People-oriented: I'm friendly and willing to talk to people (when I have to)

Topics that interests me: 
* children-related
* gender
* sexuality


### Here's more about me:
In Summer 2018, I spent three months at the Hong Kong office of The New York Times, in which one of my proudest moments is: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/world/asia/hong-kong-schools-.html, when I was able to put one of my passions, children and education, into another (journalism of course).

I lead a very weird life which you may or may not find out, but this is me in my natural state:
